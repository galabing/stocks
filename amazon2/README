procedure
=========

1. get historical data
2. run collect_tickers.py to get ticker list
3. run collect_open_dates.py to get market open dates
4. run sanitize_data.py to extract and sanitize (filling holes) historical data
5. run collect_open_dates_sanitized.py to get market open dates from sanitized
   data -- the output will be different from the output from step 3
6. move the output from step 4 to tmp dir to avoid confusion later
7. step 5 also produces debug info of open dates, pick an earliest one with at
   least N stocks trading (N = 1000)
   - 1995-01-03 was picked as the first date of an year with >= 1000 (1005)
     stocks trading (1994-11-15 was the first date with 1000 stocks trading)
   - this date is after the creation of russell 3000 (1987-09-10) so the
     result can be easily benchmarked against market performance
8. run make_price_map.py to make price map
9. choose cutoff date for training/test
   - 2005-01-01 was picked to give 10 years of training data and 8 years of
     testing data, both periods contain big ups/downs
10. run collect_training_metadata.py to collect training metadata (sampled
    dates/tickers along with gains/labels)
11. run compute_features.py to compute features; notice that features should
    be aligned with labels (eg, if predicting 1 week out, features should be
    based on fine-grained steps)
12. run collect_training_data.py to make input to libsvm
13. copy easy.py and grid.py to where the data is and run easy.py
